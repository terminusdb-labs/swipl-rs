//! Prolog initialization logic.
//!
//! When using swipl-rs to embed prolog, you need to ensure that you
//! initialize SWI-Prolog before you do anything else with
//! SWI-Prolog. The one exception is registering of foreign
//! predicates, which you're allowed to do at any point.
//!
//! Functions for both prolog initialization as well as foreign
//! predicate registration are defined here.
